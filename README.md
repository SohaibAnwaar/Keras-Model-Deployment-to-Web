4.	common.py : In this file I write code of loading machine learning model and pre-processing function
5.	inference.py : In this file I am loading my model. Pre-processing the input I get from Html page ,making prediction and sending prediction to main function
6.	Python Notebook Machine Learning : this folder contain the training of model in python notebook , have dataset and a research paper from where I got some help.
